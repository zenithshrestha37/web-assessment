Internet is basically a connection of thousands of computer interconnected through network and is used to share data and information across the interconnected devices. The information are shared and transmitted through a device router that follows Internet Protocol and Transfer Control Protocol. For example: if there are several computers connected in a network, one computer first sends informations to a router which in turn forwards the information to other computers. So, it is difficult for computer to identify which computer to send the data to. So, to solve that problem, we have IP which provides a unique address to the network. 

When we click on the link, browser and operating system will figure out where we have clicked.

HTTP server then views the website in HTML format
